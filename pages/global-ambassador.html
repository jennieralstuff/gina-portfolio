          <p>
            <em>Design brief:</em> The University of California Davis&#8217; Global Ambassador Mentorship Program has requested the creation of a brochure and poster that can be used to encourage international students to apply to become a mentee, and international and domestic students to join the program as a&nbsp;mentor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program&#8217;s overall goal is to provide a welcoming community for first year, exchange, or transfer international students to more easily adjust to the UC Davis community. Through the program mentors and mentees have the opportunity to enhance their college experience, share their cultural background, and to create lasting&nbsp;friendships.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a key component of the Global Ambassador Mentorship Program is to provide a platform for intercultural exchange and the creation of lasting friendships, I have chosen to use the friendship bracelet as a symbol for the strong connections that are made within the program. The colors are used within the bracelets to represent various countries flags to further indicate the interconnectivity of the international community within the&nbsp;program.
