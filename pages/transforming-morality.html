          "Morality is no longer a principle we can consider stable or unchanging, but must be recognized as something that is and can be constantly changed"
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of morality has always appeared to be something stable, unchangeable, natural, and impactful on a conscious and unconscious level in our lives. Despite many varying beliefs for the origins and representation of our morals as either biologically innate to human beings, arising through religion, or learned through our experiences and environmental influences, there is still no single agreed upon recognition of the origin of our morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there is no agreed upon origin of our morals, morality in terms of right and wrong has clearly and consistently been altered and transformed throughout history. This is visible from the actions and beliefs of movements as morally diverse as Hitler&#8217;s acts of genocide to Gandhi&#8217;s peace movement, where the notion of morality drastically differed in both contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of morality continues to be altered even in the present day through new mediums that have potentially become more widespread than ever before through the perpetuation of moral ideals within the media and social norms. Morality is no longer a principle we can consider stable or unchanging, but must be recognized as something that is and can be constantly changed.

          "Although there is no agreed upon origin of our morals, morality in terms of right and wrong has clearly and consistently been altered and transformed throughout history"
        </p>
        <p>
          The core of this documentary is to eliminate the divide between viewing morality as something solely personal and maintained on an individual level, to viewing morality as a set of ideals that are impacted by the role of social norms, media platforms, and other individuals that affects all individuals universally not just personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morality often appears to begin on the individual level, but it is important to remember that morality grows and develops on a community level. With these ideals, the goal of this documentary is to instill a sense of speculation and contemplation on morality within individuals who may or may not already be questioning the role of morality within their lives and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this form of contemplation, I hope to convey to individuals that morality and the idea of right and wrong can be changed/ has been changed collectively and does not need to remain as they are portrayed in the present period.
