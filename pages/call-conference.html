            <em>Design Brief:</em> After working with a team of 8 graphic design
            students to develop our own individual concepts at the University of
            California Davis, my work was chosen to represent the C.A.L.L.
            (communities, arts, lands, learning) Imagining America Conference,
            which will be hosted by UC Davis in October 2017. The C.A.L.L.
            Conference is focused on welcoming intersection through acceptance
            and understanding of differences united under a gathering for
            social&nbsp;change.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the conference centers on engaging all individuals of all skills
            within the Davis, Sacramento, and Bay area community, I chose to
            create a logo design that highlighted the all in C.A.L.L., made use
            of morse code to create a voice wave pattern for each category in
            order to indicate the sharing of one&#8217;s voice and ideas, and the use
            of four colors to represent each category of the conference. The
            posters are used to reach out to the local community and provide an
            open call to all individuals to join the conference by utilizing
            archived photographs of the Davis&nbsp;area.
